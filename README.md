Understand key frontend and backend concepts through practical implementation.
Practice component-based architecture using React and TypeScript.
Learn how to integrate APIs and manage application state effectively.
Gain experience working within a team environment using modern web technologies.


## 💻 Tech Stack
### 🖌️ Frontend:
- React with TypeScript – for building reusable, typed UI components.
- Next.js – for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- Tailwind CSS – for fast, responsive, utility-first styling.
- Context API or Redux – for global state management.

### 🐍 Backend:
- Python with Django – for building the API and handling server-side logic.
- MySQL – for managing the database.

### 🧪 Tools & Others:
- Jest – for unit and integration testing.
- REST API – for communication between the frontend and the backend.
- Git & GitHub – for version control and collaboration.

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Planning

### 🧭 Design Goals

The goal of the UI/UX design for this project is to deliver a clean, intuitive, and responsive interface that mirrors the simplicity and elegance of the real Airbnb platform. A strong emphasis is placed on user-friendliness, visual hierarchy, and ease of navigation, making it simple for users to explore listings, view details, and make bookings effortlessly.

### 🔑 Key Features to Implement

- Responsive Layouts: Mobile-first design ensuring optimal experience on all devices.
- Consistent UI Elements: Reusable components (buttons, cards, forms) across the application.
- Clear Navigation: Easy access to different sections via intuitive navigation.
- Search Functionality: Filter by location, price, and availability.
- Visual Appeal: Use of high-quality images and clean typography.
- Accessibility Considerations: Alt text for images, keyboard navigability, and semantic HTML.

### 📄 Page Descriptions

- Page Description: Property Listing View	Displays a list of available properties. Each listing includes an image, title, short description, and price. Designed to be visually engaging and easy to scan.
- Listing Page: Listing Detailed View	shows detailed information about a selected property. Includes images, amenities, location details, reviews, and pricing. Focused on clarity and comprehensive information presentation.
- Checkout Page: Simple Checkout View	provides a streamlined process for selecting dates, guest count, and finalizing a booking. Emphasis is on minimal steps and a clutter-free layout for a smooth transaction.

### 👥 Why User-Friendly Design Matters

- A user-friendly design is essential in a booking system because:
- It reduces friction in navigation and decision-making.
- It builds trust and enhances the overall user experience.
- It increases conversion rates by simplifying complex flows (e.g., booking or payment).
- It ensures accessibility for users with different needs and devices.
- It encourages users to return and engage more often with the platform.

### 📌 Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Identifying the design properties of a mockup, such as colors, fonts, and spacing, is essential to ensure consistency and accuracy in the final product. It helps developers translate the visual design into code more efficiently, maintains a cohesive user experience, and reduces miscommunication between designers and developers.
